# Introduction

Welcome to some Java Code Scribbles

WARNING!! This is a SandPit!! Things will get messy, and should always be fun!!

The SandPit is a NotePad / ScratchPad / Sandbox / LitterBox!! Kids, kittens and dogs play and work here. The space is intended for quick testing, and temp notes/scribbles. It might include some reminders. Some templates might be created for short- and medium-term experimentation. Do not get too attached to anything here, and do not take it too serious.  

Again: welcome. The SandPit is a Safe and Fun place!!
