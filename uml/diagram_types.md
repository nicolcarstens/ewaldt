UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems. It was created by the Object Management Group (OMG) and UML 2.5 is the most recent version.

UML includes several types of diagrams and among them, the structure diagrams show the static structure of the system and its parts on different abstraction and implementation levels and how they are related to each other. The elements in a structure diagram represent the meaningful concepts of a system, and may include abstract, real world and implementation concepts.

Here are the main types of UML structure diagrams:

1. **Class Diagram**: This is the main building block of UML. It depicts a static structure of a modeled system, module, or its part. It describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.

2. **Object Diagram**: This diagram is similar to a class diagram, but it focuses on the instances of classes in the system. It shows a partial or complete view of the structure of a modeled system at a specific time.

3. **Package Diagram**: This diagram shows how the various elements of a system are grouped into packages. It also shows the dependencies between these packages.

4. **Component Diagram**: This diagram describes how a software system is split up into components and shows the dependencies among these components. Components are modular parts of a system whose behavior is defined by their provided and required interfaces.

5. **Composite Structure Diagram**: This diagram shows the internal structure of a class and the collaborations that this structure makes possible. This could include the interaction between code inside a single class, or it can describe the interactions between a class and its neighbors.

6. **Deployment Diagram**: This diagram shows the configuration of run-time processing nodes and the components (software artifacts) that live on them. It visualizes the distribution of components and artifacts in an application.

7. **Profile Diagram**: This diagram helps in modeling a specific kind of platform or system, or a part of it. It's used to create new kinds of UML diagrams, tailored for a specific system or domain.

Each of these diagrams provides a different perspective on the software system being modeled. They can be used in different stages of software development, depending on the specific needs and context of the development project.
